# Generate test coverage statistics for Go packages.
#
# Works around the fact that `go test -coverprofile` currently does not work
# with multiple packages, see https://code.google.com/p/go/issues/detail?id=6909
#
# Usage: script/coverage [--html|--coveralls]
#
#     --html      Additionally create HTML report and open it in browser
#     --coveralls Push coverage statistics to coveralls.io
#
# Original: https://github.com/mlafeldt/chef-runner/blob/v0.7.0/script/coverage
# Changes: directories ending in .go used to fail, making it work only on
# master, non-pr, Linux.
